# Reflection
I gained a lot of confidence from this project. 
By adopting my learnings from the first project (have a prototype, make a to-do list), 
I felt everything was more organized even though the timeline definitely became longer.
I want to keep exploring typescript since it was definitely helpful for me to be aware of the code I'm writing.
