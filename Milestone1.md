# Project Description
I was inspired by [the sounds of CDMX project](https://pudding.cool/2022/09/cdmx/) on [pudding.com](pudding.com). Having been to Mexico City for the first time recently, I was amazed at how sounds can evoke so much memory and emotions that I want to make a similar project on my city —— Taipei.

# Tools I will use
***Basically New*** GSAP - Creating scrolling effects.

***New*** Howler.js - A useful library for sounds.

***New*** Typescript - Just something I want to get familiar with.

***New*** Vite - Build tool that I want to try out.


# Content
Audio: sourcing the audio might be the hardest part of this project. I've found some great clips on Youtube and I intend to only use the sound in the videos.

Graphic:
- Main graph: Tom Parker, a British illustrator in Taiwan, has generously agreed to let me use his illustrations.
- Food graph: I've bought a set of illustrations.

Text: I'm writing all the text myself.
