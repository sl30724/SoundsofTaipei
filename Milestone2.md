- ***New*** Vite - Build tool that I want to try out.

# Progress
## Step1: Sourcing Resource
I spent 4-5 days on searching for all the images and audios I want to include in this project. I eventually reached out to this famous British illustrator in Taiwan and asked for his permission to use his illustrations in this project. Luckily, he likes my idea and was generous enough to send me the images I want to use in high-res.

## Step2: Designing
The next 3-4 days, I focused on designing the interactive prototype and writing the content. Since there's a lot going on in the background (colors, images, and sounds), I'm using the same easy-to-read font for both title and body.

## Step3: Editing Resource
Another 2-3 days were spent on converting, editing, and compressing all the resources on Figma and iMovie.

## Step4: Environment Setup
Setting up Vite and installed all the libraries and dependencies and learning the basics of Vite took about a day.
