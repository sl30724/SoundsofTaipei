# fwd-project2

## Project Description
I was inspired by [the sounds of CDMX project](https://pudding.cool/2022/09/cdmx/) on [pudding.com](pudding.com). Having been to Mexico City for the first time recently, I was amazed at how sounds can evoke so much memory and emotions that I want to make a similar project on my city —— Taipei.

## Tools I will use
***Basically New*** GSAP - Creating scrolling effects.
***New*** Howler.js - A useful library for sounds.
***New*** Typescript - Just something I want to get familiar with.
***New*** Vite - Build tool that I want to try out.

## Content
Audio: sourcing the audio might be the hardest part of this project. I've found some great clips on Youtube and I intend to only use the sound in the videos.
Graphic: I might use (and pay if I have to) 1-2 illustrations of the same style.
Text: I'm writing all the text myself.

# Goals
#### MVP
- Scrooling effect with pinning.
- Different text paragraphs when scrolled to a specific section.
- Play sounds when scrolled to a specfic section.

#### Stretch goals
- Some sort of sound interaction with mouse hover and mouse click.
